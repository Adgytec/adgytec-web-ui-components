# Adgytec Web UI Components

So, this React component library? It's been put together super carefully to give you a really flexible and easy-to-use base for your web apps!

### Key Features & Technologies

- **Dynamic Color Theming**: The entire color palette for this library is generated using the official [Material Color Tool](https://material-foundation.github.io/material-theme-builder/). This ensures a cohesive, aesthetically pleasing, and easily manageable color system that aligns with modern design principles.

- **Unstyled & Accessible Components**: We leverage [React Aria Components](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/components.html) to provide a set of robust, unstyled components. This approach gives you complete control over the visual styling while benefiting from built-in accessibility features, ensuring your applications are inclusive and user-friendly.

- **Comprehensive Icon Set**: All icons integrated into the components are sourced from [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/guide/packages/lucide-react). This provides a consistent, high-quality, and easily scalable icon solution for your UI.

### Customization and Styling Details

- **Global Styles**: For a complete overview of all defined color variables and elevation styles used across the library, please refer to the `main.css` file.

- **Edge Radii Configuration**: The visual appearance of component edges (rounded or sharp) can be easily configured. These styles are controlled via dedicated CSS variables related to `radius`. You can find more detailed information and configuration options within the `main.css` file.

### Components Usage

- Check App.tsx for all the components example usage and you can further check implementation of each component for its usage.
